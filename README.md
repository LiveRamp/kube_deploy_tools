### kube_deploy_tools (kdt)

`kube_deploy_tools` (kdt) is a tool to simplify kubernetes manifest generation
and deployment. In short, it is able to:

* ***generate***: Kubernetes manifests from flexible [ERB] templates.
  - Templating contexts have access to a `config` Hash of options.
  - Multiple versions of the same manifests can be defined by creating separate *artifacts* and *flavors* which modify `config`.

* ***push***: Docker images tagged with the prefix `local-registry/` to your configured image registry/ies. 
    kdt will re-tag images appropriately for the destination and push in parallel.

* ***publish***: a manifest of all generated manifests, docker images and tags for archival and eventual expiration 
    of all artifacts related to a single build. 
    - Options available to build in parallel. See below:.

* ***deploy*** manifests referencing your built and pushed images out to production.

kdt is written in Ruby, but can be used with any project that deploys to Kubernetes. 
It can be seen as a lightweight alternative to more popular products like [Helm].

Each of the use cases described above is defined as a separate subcommand of the parent `kdt` command. The tools are 
singularly configured by a `deploy.yaml` document checked-in to the root of your repository. While all of these 
components are used today at [@LiveRamp](https://github.com/LiveRamp) for a complete production lifecycle, they are also 
designed to be used individually.

## Getting Started

### Install

Include the `gem 'kube_deploy_tools', '~> 3'` in your project via a Gemfile or gemspec.

### Configure

Once kdt is installed, you will need to configure it. This is done by adding a new file named `deploy.yaml` at the 
root of your project. A minimal `deploy.yaml` for deploying to [Google Container Registry] is shown below:

```yaml
version: 2                        # version of kdt to be used
default_flags:
  pull_policy: IfNotPresent       # define default k-v pairs to be made available in ERB's `config` to all artifacts and flavors
artifacts:                        # define groups of manifests as named artifacts for `kdt generate`
  - name: prod
    image_registry: gcp
    flags: {}                     # define extra k-v pairs for ERB `config` during `kdt generate` for a specific artifact
flavors:
  default:                        # define extra k-v pairs for ERB `config` during `kdt generate` for a specific flavor
    important_config: '42'        # appears in `config` for the prod/default flavor, but nowhere else
artifact_registries:              # define destination for `kdt publish`
image_registries:                 # define image registries for `kdt push`
  - name: gcp                     # `kdt push` will deploy to Google Container Registry
    driver: gcp
    prefix: gcr.io/my-gcr-project
```

You can check out a [complete description](schemas/v2.schema.json) of the `deploy.yaml` schema.

Next, create a `kubernetes/deployment.yaml.erb` file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-first-kdt-app
  labels:
    app: my-first-kdt-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-first-kdt-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-first-kdt-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: <%= config['image_registry'] %>/my-app:<%= config['tag'] %>
          imagePullPolicy: <%= config['pull_policy'] %>
    env:
      - name: IMPORTANT_CONFIG
        value: <%= config['important_config'] %>
```

Observe the use of [ERB] tags to fill in various values from the `config` Hash. The `config` hash
is generated from a combination of artifact `flags`, `flavors`, `default_flags`, and the settings
from `image_registries`. `tag` is autogenerated from your Git SCM workspace.

Now, run `bundle exec kdt generate` and observe
`build/kubernetes/prod_default/deployment.yaml` is created with all template
variables filled in.

To explore further,
* Build a docker image tagged `local-registry/my-app`, then run `kdt push my-app`.
* Run `kdt deploy -f build/kubernetes/prod_default --context my-kube-context` to send your generated
  manifests to a Kubernetes API server.

## Usage

```bash
bundle install --with development

# Run tests
bundle exec rake test

# Exec a binary in bin/
bundle exec kdt generate
# bundle exec kdt generate -o <tmp_directory> -m <deploy_yaml_manifest_file> -i <tmp_input_directory>
```

## Parallel Generate/Publish
* Most KDT actions are able to run in parallel on Jenkins without extra configurations, but the KDT publish step requires an extra argument when calling the function.
  * This is due to an internal configuration which shares a temporary directory with any other module that is also being published on the same Jenkins pipeline unless otherwise specified.
```bash
# Publish standard
bundle exec kdt publish

# Publish with extra argument capable of parallel runs in Jenkins
bundle exec kdt publish -o <tmp_directory>
```
* See [Online Identity PR](https://github.com/LiveRamp/identity/pull/1939) for further implementation details.


## FAQ

* ***Q***: Will KDT help me build my Docker images?
* ***A***: No. The recommended usage is to build your docker images ahead of time and pre-tag them as local-registry/name-here.
  Then running `kdt push name-here` will automatically retag your images with your target registry and send them off.

### Contribute
We accept [pull requests]. They will be reviewed by a member of the LiveRamp development team as soon as possible.
Once the PR is merged, GitHub will auto-draft the release. Be sure to
add the same version as a tag (vX.Y.Z) and then publish it.
[GitHub Workflow] will then publish the gems.
